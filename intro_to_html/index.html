    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hello there! My name is Casey Neal and I am currently studying 
        graphic design at Chattanooga State. I have always loved creating
        crafts and projects and thought digital media would be a cool career!
        I also enjoy playing volleyball, going to the beach with my family,
        and hanging out with my best friends!
        Hope you enjoy my website! </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Though I have not been making graphics for a long time, below is one of my favorites from last semester! I will be updating this page with lots of cool projects in the future. I'm looking forward to improving this year! The links below are some designers work that I really admire and strive to resemble one day!</p>
